> **🚀 The First Open-Source Web UI & Manager for [LF Edge eKuiper](https://ekuiper.org/) - Because the Community Deserves Better**

An open-source, community-driven web interface and management platform for eKuiper - the lightweight IoT data analytics and stream processing engine. Built because the existing closed-source solution is buggy and the community deserves a reliable, open alternative.

## 🎯 Why This Project?

**There is currently no fully open-source eKuiper management UI.** EMQ's proprietary eKuiper Manager is:
- Closed source
- Reportedly buggy and unreliable
- Not community-extensible

This project aims to fill that gap with a **completely open-source, community-driven solution**.

---

## 📋 Feature Status

### ✅ Fully Built & Working

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Swagger API Playground** | Interactive API documentation with live "Try It Out" functionality. The OpenAPI 3.0 contract covers all 140 management operations registered by eKuiper v2.4.1. |
| **Rule Tracing & Debugging** | Real-time data flow tracing with span hierarchy and detailed message attributes. |
| **Rule Topology** | Visual graph representation of the data flow from sources through operators to sinks. |
| **Query Plan (Explain)** | Visualized execution plans and performance hints for eKuiper SQL queries. |
| **AI Assistant** | Conversational agent, Rule/Stream generators, Analysis tools. (New in v1.2.0) |
| **Server Persistence** | Browser-based (Default) or SQLite (Experimental) storage for server configs. |

### 🔶 Partially Built (Functional but Incomplete)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Query Designer** | 30% | Visual builder for shop floor users. Node-based editor in progress. |
| **Rule Management** | 90% | List, start, stop, tracing, topology, and explain working. Edit with SQL working. Create with UI logic in progress. |
| **Dashboard Overview** | 70% | System info display, CPU/memory/uptime monitoring. Needs real-time refresh polish. |
| **Rule Metrics** | 70% | Basic metrics and status display. Advanced historical charts pending. |
| **eKuiper Health Check** | 80% | Ping and system info working. Connection status indicators need work. |
| **Action/Sink Configuration** | 40% | Basic MQTT sink working. Other sink types need implementation. |
| **Stream Management** | 50% | List and view streams. Create with SQL editor partially working. |

### 🚧 Under Development

| Feature | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Visual Pipeline Builder | Medium | Drag-and-drop rule builder with React Flow |
| Monaco SQL Editor | High | eKuiper SQL syntax highlighting & IntelliSense |
| MQTT Message Simulator | High | Test message generation for rule validation |
| Connection Management | Medium | Shared MQTT, Redis, SQL connections |
| Schema Registry | Low | Protobuf and JSON Schema management |
| Import/Export | Medium | Backup and restore configurations |
| Real-time Logs Viewer | Low | Filter and search server logs |
| Python Plugin Editor | Low | Custom function/source/sink development |
| Batch Rule Operations | Medium | Multi-select start/stop/delete |
| Configuration Templates | Low | Pre-configured source/sink templates |

## 🛣️ Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: MQTT-First Development (Current Priority)

**I have the capacity to fully test only MQTT-based pathways**, so those will be developed and validated first:

1. ✅ **Swagger API Playground** - Complete
2. 🔄 **MQTT Source Configuration** - In Progress
3. 🔄 **MQTT Sink Configuration** - In Progress
4. 🔄 **MQTT-based Rule Creation & Testing** - In Progress
5. ⏳ **MQTT Message Simulator** - Planned
6. ⏳ **MQTT Connection Management** - Planned

### Phase 2: Core Rule Engine Features

- ✅ Rule CRUD with validation (SQL-based)
- ✅ Rule status & basic metrics
- ✅ Rule topology visualization
- ✅ Data tracing and debugging
- ✅ Query execution plan visualization (Explain)
- ⏳ Advanced historical charts (Pending)

### Phase 3: Extended Sources & Sinks

- HTTP Pull/Push sources
- REST API sinks
- Redis pub/sub
- InfluxDB sinks
- File sources/sinks

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

- Schema registry integration
- Python plugin development environment
- Visual pipeline builder
- Import/Export functionality

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- eKuiper server running (default: http://localhost:9081)
- (Optional) OpenRouter API Key for AI features

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ankur-paan/ekuiper-manager.git
cd ekuiper-manager

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### AI Configuration (Optional)
To enable AI features, create a `.env` file and add your OpenRouter key:
```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Persistence Configuration
By default, server connections are stored in your **Browser (Local Storage)**.
To enable **Database Mode (SQLite)** (Experimental/Beta):
1. Configure `prisma` in your environment.
2. Toggle "Persistence Mode" in **Settings**.
> **Note:** Database mode is work-in-progress and may be unstable. Browser mode is recommended.

### Connect to eKuiper

1. Start your eKuiper instance
2. Navigate to the Manager Overview
3. Enter your eKuiper server URL and click Connect
4. Explore the Swagger Playground at `/api-docs`
